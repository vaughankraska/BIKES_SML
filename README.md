# Washington DC Bike Data Analysis

## Overview
Welcome to the Washington DC Bike Data Analysis project! This repository contains the code and data related to our exploration of bike-related information in Washington DC.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

1. `data/`: This directory contains the raw and processed datasets used in the analysis.
    - `raw_data/`: Raw data files go here.
    - `processed_data/`: Processed data files go here.
    - Eventually stick `predictions.csv` in here (final guesses our model gives)

2. `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.
    - `exploratory_analysis.ipynb`: Notebook for exploratory data analysis.
    - `data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for data preprocessing.
    - ...

3. `src/`: Source code for the project.
    - We will put our final model in here with finalized proccessing and runnables.
    - `main.py`: Main script for the analysis.
    - `data_processing.py`: Module for data processing functions.
    - ...

4. `environment.yml`: YAML file specifying the project's conda environment.
5. `README.md`: Documentation and instructions for the project.
